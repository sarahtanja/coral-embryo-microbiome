- Includes all PERMANOVA resources
- Links to other analysis guides

## Key Concepts Explained

### 1. How PERMANOVA Works

The documentation explains that PERMANOVA:
1. **Uses distance matrices** representing dissimilarity between samples
2. **Partitions variation** into between-group and within-group components
3. **Calculates pseudo-F statistics** as ratio of between/within variation
4. **Assesses significance via permutation** rather than parametric distributions
5. **Provides effect sizes (R²)** showing proportion of variation explained

### 2. Inputs Required

**Distance Matrix:**
- Square, symmetric matrix of pairwise distances
- Size: n × n where n = number of samples
- Common metrics: Bray-Curtis, Jaccard, UniFrac, Aitchison

**Metadata:**
- Sample IDs matching distance matrix
- Grouping variables (categorical or continuous)
- Can include multiple factors and interactions

### 3. Understanding Results

**Output Metrics:**
- **F statistic**: Strength of group separation (higher = stronger)
- **R²**: Effect size (proportion of variation explained, 0-1)
- **p-value**: Significance via permutation (p < 0.05 = significant)
- **Df**: Degrees of freedom (based on groups and samples)

**In Microbiome Context:**
- Significant p-value → groups differ in community composition
- R² shows how much variation is explained by factor
- Even small R² can be biologically meaningful
- Non-significant doesn't prove groups are identical

### 4. Critical Distinctions

**PERMANOVA vs PCA/PCoA:**
- PERMANOVA tests **distance matrices**
- PCoA provides **visualization** of patterns
- Running PERMANOVA on PCoA coordinates is **incorrect**
- Both are complementary tools

**Common Mistake:**
```r
# WRONG - don't do this!
pcoa_coords <- cmdscale(dist_matrix)
adonis2(pcoa_coords ~ treatment)  # Incorrect!

# CORRECT - do this instead
adonis2(dist_matrix ~ treatment)  # Correct!
```

## Practical Applications

2. **Choose appropriate metrics** - Select distance metrics for their data type
3. **Check assumptions** - Verify dispersion homogeneity
4. **Run analyses correctly** - Use proper workflow and code
5. **Interpret results** - Understand what significant/non-significant means
6. **Report findings** - Write clear methods and results sections
7. **Avoid pitfalls** - Recognize and prevent common mistakes
8. **Compare metrics** - Understand what different distance metrics reveal
