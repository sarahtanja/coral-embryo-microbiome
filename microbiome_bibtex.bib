  abstract     = {Mixotrophy is an important trophic strategy for bacterial
                  survival in the ocean. However, the global relevance and
                  identity of the major mixotrophic taxa remain largely elusive.
                  Here, we combined phylogenetic, metagenomic, and
                  metatranscriptomic analyses to characterize ubiquitous
                  Arcobacteraceae based on our deep-sea in situ incubations and
                  the global data. The phylogenomic tree of Arcobacteraceae is
                  divided into three large clades, among which members of clades
                  A and B are almost all from terrestrial environments, while
                  those of clade C are widely distributed in various marine
                  habitats in addition to some terrestrial origins. All clades
                  harbor genes putatively involved in chitin degradation,
                  sulfide oxidation, hydrogen oxidation, thiosulfate oxidation,
                  denitrification, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium,
                  microaerophilic respiration, and metal (iron/manganese)
                  reduction. Additionally, in clade C, more unique pathways were
                  retrieved, including thiosulfate disproportionation, ethanol
                  fermentation, methane oxidation, fatty acid oxidation,
                  cobalamin synthesis, and dissimilatory reductions of sulfate,
                  perchlorate, and arsenate. Within this clade, two mixotrophic
                  Candidatus genera represented by UBA6211 and CAIJNA01 harbor
                  genes putatively involved in the reverse tricarboxylic acid
                  pathway for carbon fixation. Moreover, the metatranscriptomic
                  data in deep-sea in situ incubations indicated that the latter
                  genus is a mixotroph that conducts carbon fixation by coupling
                  sulfur oxidation and denitrification and metabolizing organic
                  matter. Furthermore, global metatranscriptomic data confirmed
                  the ubiquitous distribution and global relevance of
                  Arcobacteraceae in the expression of those corresponding genes
                  across all oceanic regions and depths. Overall, these results
                  highlight the contribution of previously unrecognized
                  Arcobacteraceae to carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycling in
                  global oceans.IMPORTANCEMarine microorganisms exert a profound
                  influence on global carbon cycling and ecological
                  relationships. Mixotrophy, characterized by the simultaneous
                  utilization of both autotrophic and heterotrophic nutrition,
                  has a significant impact on the global carbon cycling. This
                  report characterizes a group of uncultivated bacteria
                  Arcobacteraceae that thrived on the "hot time" of bulky
                  particulate organic matter and exhibited mixotrophic strategy
                  during the in situ organic mineralization. Compared with
                  clades A and B, more unique metabolic pathways were retrieved
                  in clade C, including the reverse tricarboxylic acid pathway
                  for carbon fixation, thiosulfate disproportionation, methane
                  oxidation, and fatty acid oxidation. Global metatranscriptomic
                  data from the Tara Oceans expeditions confirmed the ubiquitous
                  distribution and extensive transcriptional activity of
                  Arcobacteraceae with the expression of genes putatively
                  involved in carbon fixation, methane oxidation, multiple
                  sulfur compound oxidation, and denitrification across all

                  Nevertheless, corals can be adapted to their thermal
                  environment and inherit heat tolerance across generations. In
                  addition, the diverse microbes that associate with corals have
                  the capacity for more rapid change, potentially aiding the
                  adaptation of long-lived corals. Here, we show that the
                  microbiome of reef corals is different across thermally

                  reciprocally transplanted. Exposing these corals to thermal
                  bleaching conditions changes the microbiome for heat-sensitive
                  corals, but not for heat-tolerant corals growing in habitats
                  with natural high heat extremes. Importantly, particular
                  bacterial taxa predict the coral host response in a short-term

                  microorganisms for corals (pBMCs), including five
                  Pseudoalteromonas sp., a Halomonas taeanensis and a Cobetia

                  Vibrio coralliilyticus, VC; pathogen challenge, VC; and

                  signs as indicated by significantly lower photopigment
                  contents and Fv/Fm ratios. The structure of the coral

                  specific bioindicators were correlated with corals inoculated

                  symbionts from nonessential commensal or transient
                  microorganisms; however, one approach is to detect strong
                  cophylogenetic patterns between microbial lineages and their
                  respective hosts. We employed the Procrustean approach to
                  cophylogeny (PACo) on 16S rRNA gene derived microbial
                  community profiles paired with COI, 18S rRNA and ITS1 host
                  phylogenies. Second, we undertook a network analysis to
                  identify groups of microbes that were co-occurring within our
                  host species. Across 12 coral, 10 octocoral and five sponge
                  species, each host group and their core microbiota (50\%
                  prevalence within host species replicates) had a significant
                  fit to the cophylogenetic model. Independent assessment of
                  each microbial genus and family found that bacteria and
                  archaea affiliated to Endozoicomonadaceae, Spirochaetaceae and
                  Nitrosopumilaceae have the strongest cophylogenetic signals.
                  Further, local Moran's I measure of spatial autocorrelation
                  identified 14 ASVs, including Endozoicomonadaceae and
                  Spirochaetaceae, whose distributions were significantly
                  clustered by host phylogeny. Four co-occurring subnetworks
                  were identified, each of which was dominant in a different
                  host group. Endozoicomonadaceae and Spirochaetaceae ASVs were
                  abundant among the subnetworks, particularly one subnetwork
                  that was exclusively comprised of these two bacterial families
                  and dominated the octocoral microbiota. Our results
                  disentangle key microbial interactions that occur within

                  settlement on fouling management coatings of various
                  toxicities can be used to predict the toxicity of the coating,
                  we hypothesized that interaction of plastic pre-production

                  indicative of the chemistry at the pellet surface. We used

                  characterize the microbiomes that developed from 8 through 70

                  consume hydrocarbons, to be prevalent following marine oil
                  spills, or to live on fouling management surfaces. Microbiomes
                  were still distinct between plastic types at Day 70,

                  winter, with a focus on two temperate (Erythropodium hicksoni,

                  to reefs in eastern Australia. Bacterial communities
                  associated with these octocorals were also compared to common
                  temperate (Plesiastrea versipora) and tropical (Acropora
                  aspera) hard corals from the same reefs. Using 16S rRNA
                  amplicon sequencing, bacterial diversity was found to be
                  heterogeneous among octocorals, but we observed changes in
                  composition between summer and winter for some species (C.

                  significantly between all octocoral species within both the

                  basis, those differences were less pronounced. The microbiomes
                  of C. gaboensis and Sinularia sp. were dominated by bacteria
                  belonging to the genus Endozoicomonas, which were a key
                  conserved feature of their core microbiomes. In contrast to
                  previous studies, our analysis revealed that Endozoicomonas
                  phylotypes are shared across different octocoral species,

  abstract     = {The coral microbiome is known to fluctuate in response to
                  environmental variation and has been suggested to vary
                  seasonally. However, most studies to date, particularly
                  studies on bacterial communities, have examined temporal
                  variation over a time frame of less than 1 year, which is
                  insufficient to establish if microbiome variations are indeed
                  seasonal in nature. The present study focused on expanding our
                  understanding of long-term variability in microbial community
                  composition using two common coral species, Acropora
                  hyacinthus, and Acropora spathulata, at two mid-shelf reefs on
                  the Great Barrier Reef. By sampling over a 2-year time period,
                  this study aimed to determine whether temporal variations
                  reflect seasonal cycles. Community composition of both
                  bacteria and Symbiodiniaceae was characterized through 16S
                  rRNA gene and ITS2 rDNA metabarcoding. We observed significant
                  variations in community composition of both bacteria and
                  Symbiodiniaceae among time points for A. hyacinthus and A.
                  spathulata. However, there was no evidence to suggest that
                  temporal variations were cyclical in nature and represented
                  seasonal variation. Clear evidence for differences in the
                  microbial communities found between reefs suggests that reef
                  location and coral species play a larger role than season in
                  driving microbial community composition in corals. In order to
                  identify the basis of temporal patterns in coral microbial
                  community composition, future studies should employ longer
                  time series of sampling at sufficient temporal resolution to
                  identify the environmental correlates of microbiome variation.},
