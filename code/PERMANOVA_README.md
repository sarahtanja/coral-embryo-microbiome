# PERMANOVA for Microbiome Data Analysis

## Overview

**PERMANOVA** (Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance) is a non-parametric statistical test used to assess whether groups of samples differ significantly in their multivariate composition. In microbiome research, PERMANOVA is commonly used to test whether microbial community composition differs across experimental treatments, time points, or other grouping variables.

## How PERMANOVA Works

### Conceptual Framework

PERMANOVA partitions multivariate variation in a distance matrix among sources (treatment groups, time points, etc.), analogous to how univariate ANOVA partitions variation in a single response variable. However, instead of calculating F-statistics based on parametric assumptions, PERMANOVA:

1. **Uses a distance matrix** representing dissimilarity between all pairs of samples
2. **Calculates pseudo-F statistics** by partitioning sums of squared distances
3. **Assesses significance via permutation** rather than assuming a parametric distribution

### Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. Distance Matrix Calculation
The analysis begins with a distance (or dissimilarity) matrix that quantifies how different each pair of samples is in terms of their microbial composition. Common distance metrics include:

- **Bray-Curtis dissimilarity**: Abundance-based, does not account for phylogeny
- **Jaccard distance**: Presence/absence-based
- **Weighted UniFrac**: Phylogenetic, abundance-weighted
- **Unweighted UniFrac**: Phylogenetic, presence/absence
- **Aitchison distance**: Euclidean distance on CLR-transformed data (recommended for compositional data)

#### 2. Partition Sums of Squares
Similar to ANOVA, PERMANOVA partitions the total sum of squared distances into:

- **Within-group sum of squares (SS_within)**: Variation among samples within the same group
- **Between-group sum of squares (SS_between)**: Variation between different groups
- **Total sum of squares (SS_total)**: Total variation across all samples

The pseudo-F statistic is calculated as:

```
F = (SS_between / df_between) / (SS_within / df_within)
```

Where df represents degrees of freedom.

#### 3. Permutation Test
Rather than comparing the F-statistic to a parametric F-distribution, PERMANOVA:

1. Calculates the observed F-statistic from the actual data
2. Randomly shuffles (permutes) group labels many times (typically 999 or 9,999 permutations)
3. Recalculates the F-statistic for each permutation
4. Compares the observed F to the distribution of permuted F-values

The **p-value** is the proportion of permuted F-values that are equal to or greater than the observed F-value:

```
p-value = (# permutations with F ≥ F_observed + 1) / (total permutations + 1)
```

### Key Assumptions

1. **Independence**: Samples should be independent (no pseudoreplication)
2. **Homogeneity of dispersions**: Groups should have similar within-group variability
   - **Important**: Violation can lead to false positives
   - Use **PERMDISP** (permutational test of multivariate dispersions) to check this assumption
3. **Exchangeability**: Under the null hypothesis, observations are exchangeable across groups

## Inputs to PERMANOVA

### Required Inputs

1. **Distance/Dissimilarity Matrix**
   - Square matrix of pairwise distances between samples
   - Must be symmetric with zeros on the diagonal
   - Size: n × n, where n = number of samples

2. **Metadata/Grouping Variables**
   - Data frame with sample IDs matching the distance matrix
   - Categorical or continuous explanatory variables (treatment, time, etc.)
   - Can include multiple factors and interactions

### Example Input Structure

```r
# Distance matrix (simplified example)
#         Sample1  Sample2  Sample3  Sample4
# Sample1    0.00    0.45    0.62    0.71
# Sample2    0.45    0.00    0.53    0.68
# Sample3    0.62    0.53    0.00    0.42
# Sample4    0.71    0.68    0.42    0.00

# Metadata
# SampleID  Treatment  Timepoint  Replicate
# Sample1   Control    4hpf       1
# Sample2   Control    4hpf       2
# Sample3   High       4hpf       1
# Sample4   High       4hpf       2
```

## Running PERMANOVA in R

### Using vegan::adonis2()

The `vegan` package provides the most commonly used PERMANOVA implementation in R:

```r
library(vegan)

# Basic PERMANOVA with single factor
permanova_result <- adonis2(
  distance_matrix ~ treatment,
  data = metadata,
  permutations = 999
)

# PERMANOVA with multiple factors and interaction
permanova_result <- adonis2(
  distance_matrix ~ treatment * timepoint,
  data = metadata,
  permutations = 999,
  by = "terms"  # sequential test of each term
)

# View results
print(permanova_result)
```

### Important Parameters

- **`permutations`**: Number of random permutations (999 or 9999 recommended)
- **`by`**: How to calculate p-values
  - `"terms"`: Sequential test (order matters, like Type I SS)
  - `"margin"`: Marginal test (order doesn't matter, like Type III SS)
- **`strata`**: For blocked/paired designs (restricts permutations within blocks)

## Interpreting PERMANOVA Results

### Output Components

A typical PERMANOVA output includes:

```
Permutation test for adonis under reduced model
Terms added sequentially (first to last)
Permutation: free
Number of permutations: 999

                    Df SumOfSqs      R2       F Pr(>F)    
treatment            3   2.5843 0.24156  4.8621  0.001 ***

treatment:timepoint  6   0.9234 0.08632  0.8685  0.663
Residuals           48   8.5302 0.51738                  
Total               59  16.8000 1.00000                  
---
Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
```

### Key Metrics

1. **Df (Degrees of Freedom)**
   - Number of groups minus 1 for each factor
   - Total sample size minus number of parameters for residuals

2. **SumOfSqs (Sum of Squares)**
   - Amount of variation explained by each term
   - Higher values indicate greater separation between groups

3. **R² (R-squared)**
   - Proportion of total variation explained by each term
   - Values range from 0 to 1
   - **Example**: R² = 0.24 means that factor explains 24% of variation

4. **F (Pseudo-F statistic)**
   - Ratio of between-group to within-group variation
   - Higher F values suggest stronger group separation
   - **Not** from a parametric F-distribution

5. **Pr(>F) (p-value)**
   - Probability of observing the data under the null hypothesis
   - **p < 0.05**: Significant difference in community composition
   - **p ≥ 0.05**: No significant difference detected

### Interpreting Results in Microbiome Context

#### Significant Effect (p < 0.05)

**What it means:**
- Microbial community composition differs significantly between groups
- The grouping variable (treatment, time, etc.) explains a significant portion of variation
- Communities are more different between groups than expected by chance

**Example interpretation:**
> "PERMANOVA revealed a significant effect of PVC leachate treatment on microbial community composition (F₃,₄₈ = 4.86, R² = 0.24, p = 0.001), indicating that leachate exposure altered the embryonic microbiome. Treatment explained 24% of the variation in community composition."

#### Non-significant Effect (p ≥ 0.05)

**What it means:**
- No statistically detectable difference in community composition between groups
- The grouping variable does not explain variation beyond what would be expected by chance
- Does **not** prove communities are identical, only that differences weren't detected

**Example interpretation:**
> "The treatment × timepoint interaction was not significant (F₆,₄₈ = 0.87, R² = 0.09, p = 0.663), suggesting that the effect of leachate on microbial composition did not differ across developmental stages."

#### R² Values

- **R² < 0.10**: Small effect (explains <10% of variation)
- **R² = 0.10-0.30**: Moderate effect
- **R² > 0.30**: Large effect

**Note**: Even small R² values can be biologically meaningful in complex microbiome data where many factors contribute to variation.

## PERMANOVA on PCA/PCoA Results

### PCoA (Principal Coordinates Analysis)

PCoA is often confused with PCA but is fundamentally different:

- **PCoA**: Ordination method that works directly with distance matrices
- **PCA**: Ordination method that works with raw data in Euclidean space

**Important distinction**: PERMANOVA tests the **distance matrix**, not the PCoA coordinates themselves.

### Correct Workflow

```r
# Step 1: Calculate distance matrix
bc_dist <- vegdist(feature_table, method = "bray")

# Step 2: Perform PCoA for visualization
pcoa_result <- cmdscale(bc_dist, k = 2, eig = TRUE)

# Step 3: Run PERMANOVA on the DISTANCE MATRIX (not PCoA coordinates!)
permanova_result <- adonis2(
  bc_dist ~ treatment * timepoint,
  data = metadata,
  permutations = 999
)

# Step 4: Visualize with PCoA
pcoa_df <- data.frame(
  PC1 = pcoa_result$points[, 1],
  PC2 = pcoa_result$points[, 2]
) %>%
  bind_cols(metadata)

ggplot(pcoa_df, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = treatment)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  labs(title = "PCoA with PERMANOVA",
       subtitle = paste0("Treatment effect: p = ", 
                        permanova_result$`Pr(>F)`[1]))
```

### Common Mistake

❌ **Incorrect**: Running PERMANOVA on PCA/PCoA coordinates
```r
# This is WRONG - don't do this!
wrong_result <- adonis2(
  pcoa_df[, c("PC1", "PC2")] ~ treatment,
  data = metadata
)
```

✅ **Correct**: Running PERMANOVA on the distance matrix
```r
# This is CORRECT
correct_result <- adonis2(
  distance_matrix ~ treatment,
  data = metadata
)
```

## Best Practices for Microbiome PERMANOVA

### 1. Check Dispersion Assumptions

Always test for homogeneity of dispersions using PERMDISP:

```r
# Test for homogeneity of dispersions
dispersion_test <- betadisper(distance_matrix, metadata$treatment)
permutest(dispersion_test, pairwise = TRUE)

# Visualize dispersions
plot(dispersion_test, main = "Multivariate Dispersions")
boxplot(dispersion_test, main = "Dispersion by Group")
```

**If dispersions differ significantly:**
- PERMANOVA results may be unreliable
- Consider using a different distance metric
- Transform data differently
- Report dispersion results alongside PERMANOVA

### 2. Choose Appropriate Distance Metrics

**For compositional data (microbiome counts):**
- **Aitchison distance** (CLR-transformed Euclidean): Recommended by Gloor et al. 2017
- Accounts for compositionality and avoids spurious correlations

**For phylogenetic data:**
- **Weighted/Unweighted UniFrac**: Incorporates evolutionary relationships
- Weighted for abundance-based, unweighted for presence/absence

**General:**
- **Bray-Curtis**: Good for abundance data, ignores double-zeros
- **Jaccard**: Presence/absence, simple and interpretable

### 3. Use Adequate Permutations

- **Minimum**: 999 permutations for p-values to 0.001 precision
- **Better**: 9,999 permutations for p-values to 0.0001 precision
- **Note**: More permutations = longer computation time but better precision

### 4. Consider Sequential vs. Marginal Tests

```r
# Sequential (Type I) - order matters
adonis2(dist ~ A + B + A:B, data = meta, by = "terms")

# Marginal (Type III) - order doesn't matter
adonis2(dist ~ A + B + A:B, data = meta, by = "margin")
```

**Recommendation**: Use `by = "margin"` for balanced designs with interactions.

### 5. Report Effect Sizes

Always report R² alongside p-values:

> "Treatment significantly affected community composition (PERMANOVA: F = 4.86, R² = 0.24, p = 0.001), explaining 24% of the variation."

### 6. Perform Post-hoc Pairwise Tests

If overall PERMANOVA is significant with >2 groups, conduct pairwise comparisons:

```r
# Pairwise PERMANOVA between treatment groups
pairwise_results <- pairwise.adonis2(
  distance_matrix ~ treatment,
  data = metadata
)

# Apply multiple testing correction
pairwise_results$p.adjusted <- p.adjust(
  pairwise_results$p.value,
  method = "fdr"
)
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Pitfall 1: Pseudoreplication

**Problem**: Including technical replicates or non-independent samples

**Solution**: 
- Average technical replicates before analysis
- Use `strata` parameter for nested/blocked designs
- Ensure biological replicates are truly independent

### Pitfall 2: Ignoring Dispersion Differences

**Problem**: Groups with different dispersions violate PERMANOVA assumptions

**Solution**:
- Always run PERMDISP first
- If dispersions differ, interpret PERMANOVA cautiously
- Consider alternative distance metrics or transformations

### Pitfall 3: Low Sample Size

**Problem**: Too few samples limit power and valid permutations

**Solution**:
- Minimum 5-10 samples per group recommended
- With small n, use `perm.max` to limit permutations
- Report power analysis or effect sizes

### Pitfall 4: Multiple Distance Metrics

**Problem**: Testing same hypothesis with multiple distance metrics inflates Type I error

**Solution**:
- Choose one primary distance metric a priori
- If testing multiple, apply multiple testing correction
- Report all metrics tested (avoid selective reporting)

## Example: Complete PERMANOVA Analysis

Here's a complete workflow for microbiome data:

```r
library(vegan)
library(tidyverse)
library(compositions)
library(zCompositions)

# 1. Load and prepare data
feature_table <- read.csv("feature_table.csv", row.names = 1)
metadata <- read.csv("metadata.csv")

# 2. CLR transformation for compositional data
feature_nozero <- cmultRepl(t(feature_table), method = "CZM")
feature_clr <- clr(feature_nozero)

# 3. Calculate Aitchison distance
aitchison_dist <- dist(feature_clr, method = "euclidean")

# 4. Check dispersion assumptions
disp_treatment <- betadisper(aitchison_dist, metadata$treatment)
disp_timepoint <- betadisper(aitchison_dist, metadata$timepoint)

permutest(disp_treatment)
permutest(disp_timepoint)

# 5. Run PERMANOVA
permanova_result <- adonis2(
  aitchison_dist ~ treatment * timepoint,
  data = metadata,
  permutations = 999,
  by = "margin"
)

print(permanova_result)

# 6. If significant, run pairwise tests
if (permanova_result$`Pr(>F)`[1] < 0.05) {
  # Pairwise comparisons for treatment
  treatments <- unique(metadata$treatment)
  pairwise_p <- matrix(NA, length(treatments), length(treatments))
  
  for(i in 1:(length(treatments)-1)) {
    for(j in (i+1):length(treatments)) {
      subset_idx <- metadata$treatment %in% c(treatments[i], treatments[j])
      subset_dist <- as.dist(as.matrix(aitchison_dist)[subset_idx, subset_idx])
      subset_meta <- metadata[subset_idx, ]
      
      pair_result <- adonis2(
        subset_dist ~ treatment,
        data = subset_meta,
        permutations = 999
      )
      
      pairwise_p[i, j] <- pair_result$`Pr(>F)`[1]
    }
  }
  
  # Apply FDR correction
  pairwise_p_adj <- p.adjust(pairwise_p[!is.na(pairwise_p)], method = "fdr")
}

# 7. Visualize with PCoA
pcoa <- cmdscale(aitchison_dist, k = 2, eig = TRUE)
variance_explained <- pcoa$eig[1:2] / sum(pcoa$eig) * 100

pcoa_df <- data.frame(
  PC1 = pcoa$points[, 1],
  PC2 = pcoa$points[, 2]
) %>%
  bind_cols(metadata)

ggplot(pcoa_df, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = treatment, shape = timepoint)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.8) +
  labs(
    title = "PCoA of Microbiome Composition",
    subtitle = sprintf("PERMANOVA: Treatment R²=%.2f, p=%.3f", 
                      permanova_result$R2[1],
                      permanova_result$`Pr(>F)`[1]),
    x = paste0("PC1 (", round(variance_explained[1], 1), "%)"),
    y = paste0("PC2 (", round(variance_explained[2], 1), "%)")
  ) +
  theme_bw()
```

## Reporting PERMANOVA Results

### In Methods Section

> "To test for differences in microbial community composition, we performed permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) using the `adonis2` function in the vegan package (version X.X) in R (version X.X.X). We calculated Aitchison distance matrices from centered log-ratio (CLR)-transformed feature tables. PERMANOVA models included treatment, developmental stage, and their interaction as fixed effects. Significance was assessed using 999 permutations. We verified the assumption of homogeneity of multivariate dispersions using PERMDISP."

### In Results Section

> "PERMANOVA revealed significant effects of both PVC leachate treatment (F₃,₄₈ = 4.86, R² = 0.24, p = 0.001) and developmental stage (F₂,₄₈ = 4.98, R² = 0.16, p = 0.001) on microbial community composition, collectively explaining 40% of the variation. However, the treatment × stage interaction was not significant (F₆,₄₈ = 0.87, R² = 0.09, p = 0.663), indicating that treatment effects were consistent across developmental stages. Pairwise comparisons showed that high leachate treatment differed significantly from control (p_adj = 0.003) but low and mid treatments did not (p_adj > 0.1)."

## Summary

PERMANOVA is a powerful, non-parametric test for comparing multivariate community composition across groups. For microbiome data:

✓ **Use CLR-transformed data** and Aitchison distance when possible

✓ **Check dispersion assumptions** with PERMDISP

✓ **Report effect sizes** (R²) alongside p-values

✓ **Use adequate permutations** (≥999)

✓ **Visualize results** with PCoA ordination

✗ **Don't run PERMANOVA on PCoA coordinates** - use the distance matrix

✗ **Don't ignore dispersion violations**

✗ **Don't forget pairwise tests** for >2 groups

PERMANOVA complements PCoA visualization by providing statistical evidence for whether observed clustering patterns are significant.
