## Analysis Notes

- Data was processed using QIIME2 with DADA2 denoising (270x200 trim parameters)
- Chloroplast and mitochondrial sequences were filtered from the dataset
- Differential abundance was assessed using Maaslin2 with fixed effects for leachate treatment and timepoint, and random effects for cross
- Functional predictions were generated using PICRUSt2 and analyzed with TSS normalization
- 732 significantly different bacteria were identified across leachate levels and developmental timepoints
- After filtering, Shannon diversity increased from 4.6 to 5.7 on average
